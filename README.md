# Electrcity Bill Mangement System (DBMS)

## Objective 

The main objective of this project was to develop a DBMS with GUI to simplify the electricity billing process.

## About Project

We have made a Database Management System that registers a customerâ€™s data like their address, meter number, meter reading, type of account (either domestic, industrial or commercial) and calculates the tariff to process the bill and send an invoice to the customer. The database management system also gives the Database Administrators (DBAs) ability to revamp the data. 

These sets of computer programs that control the creation, management, maintenance, and the use of the database will allow organizations to place control of the database development in the hands of Database Administrators (DBAs) and other specialists. The system is made properly and all the testing is done as per the requirements. So, the rest of the things depend on the user and no one can harm the data or the software if proper care is done. 

## Future Scope

The project has been entirely built on Tkinter and Python with MySQL as the Database Framework. 
The project can be replicated by using Flask as the GUI framework.
